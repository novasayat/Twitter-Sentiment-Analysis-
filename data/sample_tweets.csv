I absolutely love the new AI features in this app, super helpful!
The service was okay, nothing special but not bad either.
Support team resolved my issue quickly, great experience.
This update made the app slower and more confusing.
Really happy with the clean interface and fast performance.
The pricing is too high for what it offers.
I am impressed by the documentation quality.
Not sure how I feel about this release yet.
Terrible onboarding flow, I got stuck in step 2.
Excellent value for money, highly recommended.
Works fine most of the time, with occasional glitches.
The bug fixes are noticeable and much appreciated.
I regret upgrading, many features are now broken.
Very intuitive product, easy for beginners.
Neutral experience overall, it does what it says.
